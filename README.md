# Project 1

## Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## You can use the app on Heroku!
### https://project1course.herokuapp.com/

## Explanation
When the app starts you will be redirected to the login page (login.html), where you can log in if you have a user or go to the registry through a link.

On the registration page (register.html), you can write a username and password.

Once you have logged into the app, you will be redirected to a page where you can search (search.html) using an isbn, author or title.

You can click on a book to see its characteristics, the average rating and number of ratings the work has received from Goodreads or or leave your opinion about the book (book.html).

Finally, you can access an API through the url /api/<isbn> where it will return a JSON with various characteristics of the book.
